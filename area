PROGRAM:
Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively. Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes.

INPUT FORMAT: 
First input: a side of a square in integer 
Second input: length of a rectangle in integer 
Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer 
Fourth input: radius of a circle in float 
OUTPUT FORMAT: 
The first output should be the area of a square in integer 
The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer 
The third output should be the area of a circle in float with 2 decimal places

SAMPLE INPUT:

12.56

SOLUTION:
side=int(input())
length=int(input())
breadth=int(input())
radius=float(input())
square=side*side
rectangle=length*breadth
circle=3.14*radius*radius
print(square)
print(rectangle)
print('%.2f'%circle)
